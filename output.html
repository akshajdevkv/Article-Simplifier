Not everything is weighed with equal importance when you start learning any subject.</p><p class="ij ik dp il b ej im in io em ip iq ir is it er iu iv iw eu ix iy iz ex ja jb dh eh" id="17ff">Whatever you choose to learn or study, start with the basics. Don’t get smart about basic knowledge first. You are better off knowing the root of a subject than looking out for leaves and branches with no firm foundation.</p><p class="ij ik dp il b ej im in io em ip iq ir is it er iu iv iw eu ix iy iz ex ja jb dh eh" id="de75">Start by doing what everybody else did. Once you master the basics, you can go out and do your own thing. Learn from the experts. Widen your horizons and emulate the experts.</p><blockquote class="jd"><p class="je jf dp dq b jg jh ji jj jk jl jb ez" id="5f60">When it comes to learning, it pays to know which material hangs from a branch and those that make up the base of the trunk of your tree.</p></blockquote><p class="je jf dp dq b jg jh ji jj jk jl jb ez" id="5f60">When it comes to learning, it pays to know which material hangs from a branch and those that make up the base of the trunk of your tree.</p><p class="ij ik dp il b ej jn in io em jo iq ir is jp er iu iv jq eu ix iy jr ex ja jb dh eh" id="3548">Musk is a master of understanding the core of his industries — and what he should be focusing on first to build a firm foundation.</p><p class="ij ik dp il b ej im in io em ip iq ir is it er iu iv iw eu ix iy iz ex ja jb dh eh" id="6d03">He never learns a piece of information at random — everything must connect back to the deeper, more solid base.</p><p class="ij ik dp il b ej im in io em ip iq ir is it er iu iv iw eu ix iy iz ex ja jb dh eh" id="4c0c">Elon Musk says “when you want to learn something, you have got to boil it down to its simplest form, and then work your way up from there. You can never learn from others’ work.”</p><p class="ij ik dp il b ej im in io em ip iq ir is it er iu iv iw eu ix iy iz ex ja jb dh eh" id="621b">If you want to learn anything faster, start with the materials at the bottom and work your way up.
